 A Graphical Password Authentication system is an authentication system that uses some combination of graphical images replacing the regular passwords. Graphical passwords may offer better security than text-based passwords because most of the people use regular, popular passwords everywhere and are prone to social engineering attacks. So graphical passwords can put stop to many attacks of this kind.This will allow the user to set passwords in the form of a graphical presentation in a certain pattern and later use that pattern to log in to the system. Remembering numerous passwords from various sites can be difficult for a user. So to provide some flexibility we can provide users a graphical password authentication system where instead of creating a password a user has to select graphical objects in a particular order to keep it as their password.
